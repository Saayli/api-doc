<h1>Partner authentication</h1>

<div class="alert alert-danger">Beware! This API is deprecated. If you rely on this API, you should get in touch with us.</div>

<p>If you are a DoYouBuzz Partner with a private CV database, you can access the Partner API.</p>

	<p><strong>Please note this API is deprecated and will be removed soon. If you rely on this API to access your data, please contact us.</strong></p>

<h2>Access protected resources</h2>

<p>To access a protected ressource, send a <span class="label label-info">GET</span> request to the resource (full list avaiable on the left-menu, under Partner API) with your your apiKey and apiSecret. You can get your apiKey and apiSecret by contacting DoYouBuzz.

<h2>Example</h2>
<span class="label label-info">GET</span> <code> https://api.doyoubuzz.com/user/?userId=:id&apiKey:apiKey&apiSecret:apiSecret</code>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>User authorization</h2>
<p>When a user joins a private CV database, the user's authorization is handled directy by DoYouBuzz so you don't need to request his authorization. Please note : as in a oAuth process, the user can remove his authorization when he wants.</p>
